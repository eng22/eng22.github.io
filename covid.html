        <div class="about-content">
          <p> Around half of the world's population is on lockdown in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19. Every
            country is trying to contain the virus spread and has taken necessary measures towards it. Scandinavian
            countries have done a great job and implemented great strategies to stop the growth of the virus. Since the
            countries are similar geographically, population-wise, hence it will be interesting to see the impact of
            COVID-19 in Scandinavia. Here we are addressing some crucial figures and statistics about the growth and
            response of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Iceland to COVID.

        <h4>Impact of Covid-19 in Scandinavia</h4>
        </p>
        The growth of the coronavirus in the five Scandinavian countries can be seen below: The following contains
        Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recovered Cases, and active Cases for countries. By scrolling over each country line we
        can see country statistics, which will show the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recovery, and active cases
        with respect to time.
        Scroll over each line to see country statistics.

          src="https://plotly.com/~eng22/37.embed" height=1200 width="100%"></iframe>
        </br>It can be observed that Sweden's growth is drastically increased with deaths and confirmed cases and also
        has the most number of active cases which is high in comparison to other similar countries. In contrast, Denmark
        has the highest number of recovery and flatten the curve for death and confirmed cases. Finland and Norway where
        the trend is pretty much similar to the spread of the virus. However, Norway has the least number of recovery
        followed by Iceland. Considering the number of deaths, Sweden has thrice the number of cases in comparison with
        other countries.

      <h4>Confirmed cases of covid-19 by age group and gender.</h4>
      </p>
      <p>Here, our take is to identify and understand the influence of coronavirus based on different age groups and
        gender. The following demographics depicts the percentage of people infected over time by age group for the
        respective countries. Float the cursor on the plots to get a detailed insight for each county. </p>

      <iframe id="igraph1" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
        src="https://plotly.com/~eng22/50.embed" height=500 width="100%"></iframe>

      The above demographic (normalized data) shows that the majority of confirmed cases among every country are of age
      '50-59 years'. The average percentage is between 17.5% to 19.4% which shows that the difference in percentage is
      at most roughly 2% between every country. It is possible to see that the data for '40-49 years' and '50-59 years'
      together take up around 30%-35% of the total number of cases. However, Sweden seems to have less percentage than
      the other countries, but a higher percentage of '70-79 years' and '80 years and older'. On the other hand, the
      infant's show is less at risk. Middle age 'Icelandic' people suffered the most 6%. And the teenagers '10-19 years'
      has also a small percentage that is at 5.2%. The people above 60 age groups who are at risk do not vary a lot
      between the countries, except Finland that has roughly 1 % of the cases. The rest of the countries har between 10%
      and 13.5% of the total number of confirmed cases.
      It can be observed that infants and younger people are likely to get less infected. However, the middle age group
      is at a higher risk of getting infected. </br></br>
      <p>
      <h4>Distribution of confirmed cases by gender</h4>
      </p>

      <iframe id="igraph1" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
        src="https://plotly.com/~eng22/52.embed" height=500 width="100%"></iframe>

      When looking at the distribution of the confirmed cases by gender, it is easy to observe that the data is almost
      50/50 which indicates that genders do not seem to play a significant role. Although the difference is small, every
      country has most cases of women. However, this can be a result of the physiological difference between the
      genders. More women are worried about their health care situation than men, according to a Bankrate.com survey.
      This means that women might have a lower threshold for testing themselves based on flu symptoms.

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p> It is interesting to see how Scandinavian countries manage to contain the virus spread. It is relevant to
            roughly
            look into the different strategies of the Scandinavian countries. The populations of Denmark, Norway, and
            Finland
            are similar, and they have chosen very similar strategies after their first cases at the end of February.
            The
            first case of COVID-19 was reported in Denmark and Norway in late February. Within the next two weeks,
            countries
            announce a national lockdown also imposing a travel ban and closing the borders. However, Finland had
            noticed
            the
            first case of the corona at the end of January but managed to contain the spread at the time by quarantine
            and
            contact tracing. A month later, on February 26, Finland identified another case of corona and the spread.
            Hence,
            Finland declared a state of emergency on March 16, closed schools and public facilities, and restricted the
            national borders. </br></br>
            On the other hand, Sweden with roughly double inhabitants of the other countries has chosen a very different
            strategy. They have maintained society almost the same way as before its first case in late January. They
            have
            borders open for other members of the European Union, and schools, restaurants, shops, and bars remain open.
            Iceland has a small population with around 365 000 people. However, it also has an infection rate of 1 case
            per
            204 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world. This could be attributed to more tests carried out per
            capita
            than any other country.</br></br>

            Overall, after imposing national lockdown with the immediate effect of virus spread, all the Scandinavian
            countries contained the virus growth and flattered the curve except Sweden. As Sweden has taken another
            route
            to
            tackle the situation by not imposing lockdown and testing the positive patients aggressively.
